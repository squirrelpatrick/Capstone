# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'
# Go here for the original blog post and solutions
# http://www.r-bloggers.com/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already

install.packages(c("cluster", "rattle","NbClust"))

# Now load the data and look at the first few rows
data(wine, package="rattle")
head(wine)

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function


df <- scale(wine[-1])



# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters. 

wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
	              wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
               	      for (i in 2:nc){
		        set.seed(seed)
	                wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)}
	                
		      plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
	                        ylab="Within groups sum of squares")
	   }

wssplot(df)

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest?
#         - Between 3-13 clusters. 3 looks perhaps best

#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it?
#         - we can see how the addition of additional cluster affects the 'clusterpower',
#         - i.e. the closer the data is to the center of the clusters the better.
#         - When the graph levels off additional clusters are having limited benefit.

#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works
#         - ok
#         - for the clusters = 1, it is calculated manually by computing the sample variance
#         - of each column using apply() and then converting back
#         - after that it is pulling the figures from the kmeans function 
#         - calling all the different clustering sizes.



# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

library(NbClust)
set.seed(1234)
nc <- NbClust(df, min.nc=2, max.nc=15, method="kmeans")
barplot(table(nc$Best.n[1,]),
	          xlab="Numer of Clusters", ylab="Number of Criteria",
		            main="Number of Clusters Chosen by 26 Criteria")


# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?
#     - 3


# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

fit.km <- kmeans(df, centers = 3)

# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$clusters
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?

table(wine$Type, fit.km$cluster)

# looks good close matching with wine$Type


# Exercise 6:
# * Visualize these clusters using  function clusplot() from the cluster library
# * Would you consider this a good clustering?

library("cluster")
clusplot(wine, clus = fit.km$cluster)

# Marvellous!
